Authentication (Who is the user?)
	Knowledge Based authentication providing password/pincode
	Possession Based authentication handled using AccessToken, Phone / Text messages
	MultiFactor authentication combination of Knowledge and Possession based authentication.

Authorization (Are they allowed to do this?)
	Principal (currently logged in user)
	Granted Authority (Authority to perform an action)
	Roles (Group of authorities assigned together when a security filter processes a request, it goes to the AuthenticationManager interface, whose default implementation ProviderManager uses AuthenticationProvider interface to find the appropriate authentication provider (DaoAuthenticationProvider, JWTAuthenticationProvider, etc).

Flow:
	request -> Servlet Container (Tomcat) -> Filter Chains(SecurityFilterChain - Can be Multiple Layers) -> Dispatcher Servlet -> Interceptors -> Controller

Types of Authentication Filters
	UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter - Handles form-based authentication
	BasicAuthenticationFilter - Implements HTTP Basic Authentication
	BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter - Supports JWT authentication

Spring Security Flow
	Based on the configuration a filter is selected.
	Selected Filter will create an Authentication object.
	Authentication Object is given to AuthenticationManager (Interface) which has default implementation ProviderManager from spring boot.
	ProviderManager manager delegates the authentication to AuthenticationProvider.

	The default AuthenticationProvider in Spring Security is DaoAuthenticationProvider. This provider:
		Authenticates users against a database or data source
		Uses UserDetailsService to load user information
		Performs password validation using PasswordEncoder
		Supports username/password authentication tokens
		DaoAuthenticationProvider uses PasswordEncoder to compare Raw password from the authentication request with Encoded password retrieved from UserDetailsService

	DaoAuthenticationProvider provies Authentication Object (True/false) to the AuthenticationManager.
	AuthenticationManager returns back to the filter.
	Filter stores Fully Authentication Object in the security context.
	Security Context is added in to the request and moves to dispatcher servlet.

	Implementations of UserDetailsService (Interface)
		InMemoryUserDetailsManager (manage username/password in memory)
		JdbcUserDetailsManager (manage username/password in db)

Form Based Login (Default & Stateful Authentication)
	Stateful Authentication means, server maintains the user authentication state (aka Session/HTTP Session).
	So user will don't have to provide username/password everytime with each request.
	On successful authentication, a session (JSESSIONID) is created to maintain the user authentication state accross different requests.
	With the subsequent requests client only passes JSESSIONID and  not username/password. And server validates it with stored JSESSIONID.
	By default TTL for Session is 30 Minutes if it is inactive & can be customized with property server.servlet.session.timeout
	Comes with default /login & /logout URL
